AuraTune is an intelligent music player that uses **AI-powered emotion detection** and **biometric sensing** to create playlists that match your mood in real time.  
Developed as my **Final Year B.Tech Project**, AuraTune demonstrates the seamless blend of **artificial intelligence, music, and user experience**.

‚úÖ This version won‚Äôt throw formatting errors.  
It‚Äôs clean, consistent with your sample, and fully ready to paste into GitHub.  

Do you want me to also **generate the `architecture.png` diagram** (as a ready-to-use flowchart image) so you can just drop it into your `screenshots` folder?
```
